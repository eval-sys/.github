[EVAL SYS](https://github.com/eval-sys) is a living, open-source community to track and advance model agentic capabilities. We’ll be releasing benchmarks, datasets, toolchains, models to push the field forward.
Initiated by [LobeHub](https://github.com/lobehub), we would love to collaborate with research labs, MCP servers, independent contributors, and more.

**Join us, contribute, or reach out！**

## [MCPMark](https://mcpmark.ai): Stress-Testing Comprehensive MCP Use

An evaluation suite for agentic models in real MCP tool environments (Notion / GitHub / Filesystem / Postgres / Playwright).

MCPMark provides a reproducible, extensible benchmark for researchers and engineers: one-command tasks, isolated sandboxes, auto-resume for failures, unified metrics, and aggregated reports.
