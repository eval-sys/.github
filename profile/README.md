[EVAL SYS](https://github.com/eval-sys) is a living, open-source community to track and advance model agentic capabilities. We’ll be releasing benchmarks, datasets, toolchains, models to push the field forward.
Initiated by [LobeHub](https://github.com/lobehub), we would love to collaborate with research labs, MCP servers, independent contributors, and more.
